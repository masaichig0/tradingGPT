Baruch thinks that inflation is cooling down and this bodes well for equity markets.\\n\\nBaruch further spoke about the tech rally we have experienced so far. He talked about some of the recent gains of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and noted that \"semiconductors are showing really terrific leadership\". Baruch noted that the focus of semiconductor stocks was not the weakness in PC demand, but instead it was Samsung\\'s (KSE:005930) recently announced production cut. On April 7, Samsung (KSE:005930) announced that it is cutting memory chip output after the company\\'s Q1 2023 operating profit fell to $455.5 million, the lowest since the global financial crisis. Samsung (KSE:005930) believes that cutting memory chip production by a \"meaningful\" level will help it restore the supply-demand imbalance within semiconductors and survive a potential downturn. Here are some comments from Bill Baruch:\\n\\n\"The Samsung (KSE:005930) news of cutting chip production was the focus of semiconductors and not the slowing PC demand, and I think that\\'s because PC demand has been known to be slowing. That\\'s a lagging number for quarter 1. Let\\'s look ahead, when you see the inventory cycles of the semiconductors, and we\\'re getting out of the worst of it. The focus isn\\'t right here right now, it\\'s the 2024, and that is really becoming a tailwind to semiconductors who wrote down those expectations in the middle of last year. Again, it\\'s a market of have and have-nots. The stocks that have written down those expectations and the companies that have not. We\\'re starting to see this focus into the 2024 numbers, and my reason to bring that up is that it gives the market (semiconductor market) leadership here.\"\\n\\nThough \"having the leadership within the market is extremely important\", Bill Baruch noted that it has to be coupled with inflation coming down since inflation remains the Fed\\'s top priority. As inflation cools down, the Fed can stop its hiking cycle and this will create a positive environment for semiconductors and the tech space.\\n\\nHeading into 2024, Bill Baruch expects semiconductor stocks to lead the market as inflation cools down and the Fed stops tightening. In the current market environment, many semiconductor stocks have bottomed and are currently trading at attractive valuations. We have compiled a list of the best undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Let\\'s discuss these stocks in detail below.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo determine the best undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy now, we screened for semiconductor companies that are trading at a trailing twelve-month price-to-earnings multiple of less than 15, as of April 14. We found 18 such companies. Next, we sourced the hedge fund sentiment for each stock from Insider Monkey\\'s proprietary database of 943 hedge funds.
