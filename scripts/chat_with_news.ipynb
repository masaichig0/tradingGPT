The company posted earnings of $6.61 per share on revenue of $15.13 billion. Analysts called for earnings of $6.06 per share and revenue of $15.03 billion, according to Refinitiv.\\n\\nPowerSchool Holdings – The educational technology stock added 3.5% after Goldman Sachs upgraded shares to buy from neutral. The firm said the company is a leader in the space and can drive growth through international expansion and cross-selling products.\\n\\nNvidia – The chipmaker saw shares rise more than 3% after HSBC gave them a double upgrade, saying investors aren\\'t fully pricing in Nvidia\\'s \"incredible AI pricing power\" into the stock. The company could extend its 85% year-to-date rally even further, according to HSBC.\\n\\nChubb – Shares climbed 1% after Citi upgraded Chubb to buy from neutral. The Wall Street firm said the property and casualty brokerage is a buying opportunity, given its \"incremental strength in reserves.\" The firm expects Chubb\\'s \"high-net-worth exposure skew is relatively more insulated from negative inflationary/economic risk.\"\\n\\nMicrosoft – The tech giant were down slightly with a 0.4% decline in midday trading. Microsoft stock closed about 1% higher on Monday following a weekend report from The New York Times that Samsung phones may move to switch their default search engine to Bing and away from Google.\\n\\nBank of America – The bank stock was about flat even after the firm reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations. Its strong results were driven by higher rates as net interest income jumped 25% year over year. CEO Brian Moynihan said he sees a relatively mild recession in the U.S.\\n\\nBank of New York Mellon – The bank\\'s shares dropped 0.3% after a mixed first-quarter earnings report. While the bank\\'s earnings came in line with Wall Street\\'s estimates, its revenue came in below expectations. The company posted $4.36 billion in revenue, compared to the $4.40 billion anticipated by Wall Street, according to Refinitiv.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs – Shares slid 1.3% after Goldman Sachs reported first-quarter revenue of $12.22 billion, lower than the $12.79 billion forecasted by analysts polled by Refinitiv. The investment bank also reported a $470 million hit tied to a partial sale of its Marcus loans portfolio.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson – Shares of the health-care products company declined 2.7% despite reporting an earnings and revenue beat for the first quarter. The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.68 per share and revenue of $24.75 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had estimated per-share earnings of $2.50 and $23.67 billion in revenue. The company reported a net loss of $68 million, or 3 cents per share, stemming from its talc-based baby powder troubles and costs from its upcoming spin-off of its consumer health business.\\n\\nSouthwest Airlines – Shares of the airline fell more than 1% after computer issues on Tuesday led Southwest to ground flights around the country. At least 1,500 flights, or 36% of Southwest\\'s schedule, were delayed, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.\\n\\nBellus Health, GSK – Bellus shares roughly doubled after GSK said it would acquire Canada-based biopharmaceutical company Bellus. Bellus\\'s stock jumped 98%; the U.S.-listed shares of GSK dipped 1.6%.\\n\\n— CNBC\\'s Brian Evans, Alex Harring, Hakyung Kim, Yun Li, Tanaya Macheel and Pia Singh contributed reporting.\\n\\nSubscribe to CNBC PRO\\n\\nLicensing & Reprints\\n\\nCNBC Councils\\n\\nSelect Personal Finance\\n\\nCNBC on Peacock\\n\\nJoin the CNBC Panel\\n\\nSupply Chain Values\\n\\nSelect Shopping\\n\\nClosed Captioning\\n\\nDigital Products\\n\\nNews Releases\\n\\nInternships\\n\\nCorrections\\n\\nAbout CNBC\\n\\nAd Choices\\n\\nSite Map\\n\\nPodcasts\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNews Tips\\n\\nGot a confidential news tip?

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Now.\\n\\n\"Semiconductors Are Showing Really Terrific Leadership\"\\n\\nOn April 11 Bill Baruch, president and COO of Blue Creek Capital Management, appeared in an interview on TD Ameritrade Network\\xa0where he discussed the current trends in the semiconductor industry and his outlook for semiconductor stocks. Baruch thinks that inflation is cooling down and this bodes well for equity markets.\\n\\nBaruch further spoke about the tech rally we have experienced so far. He talked about some of the recent gains of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and noted that \"semiconductors are showing really terrific leadership\". Baruch noted that the focus of semiconductor stocks was not the weakness in PC demand, but instead it was Samsung\\'s (KSE:005930) recently announced production cut. On April 7, Samsung (KSE:005930) announced that it is cutting memory chip output after the company\\'s Q1 2023 operating profit fell to $455.5 million, the lowest since the global financial crisis. Samsung (KSE:005930) believes that cutting memory chip production by a \"meaningful\" level will help it restore the supply-demand imbalance within semiconductors and survive a potential downturn. Here are some comments from Bill Baruch:\\n\\n\"The Samsung (KSE:005930) news of cutting chip production was the focus of semiconductors and not the slowing PC demand, and I think that\\'s because PC demand has been known to be slowing. That\\'s a lagging number for quarter 1. Let\\'s look ahead, when you see the inventory cycles of the semiconductors, and we\\'re getting out of the worst of it. The focus isn\\'t right here right now, it\\'s the 2024, and that is really becoming a tailwind to semiconductors who wrote down those expectations in the middle of last year. Again, it\\'s a market of have and have-nots. The stocks that have written down those expectations and the companies that have not. We\\'re starting to see this focus into the 2024 numbers, and my reason to bring that up is that it gives the market (semiconductor market) leadership here.\"\\n\\nThough \"having the leadership within the market is extremely important\", Bill Baruch noted that it has to be coupled with inflation coming down since inflation remains the Fed\\'s top priority. As inflation cools down, the Fed can stop its hiking cycle and this will create a positive environment for semiconductors and the tech space.\\n\\nHeading into 2024, Bill Baruch expects semiconductor stocks to lead the market as inflation cools down and the Fed stops tightening. In the current market environment, many semiconductor stocks have bottomed and are currently trading at attractive valuations. We have compiled a list of the best undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Let\\'s discuss these stocks in detail below.\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nTo determine the best undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy now, we screened for semiconductor companies that are trading at a trailing twelve-month price-to-earnings multiple of less than 15, as of April 14.

Lockheed Martin beat Wall Street's expectations in the first quarter and reaffirmed its full-year guidance. Johnson & Johnson reported strong first quarter sales and raised its 2023 guidance midpoints. Bank of America topped first-quarter expectations on the top and bottom lines, while Sunrun was upgraded by KeyBanc and could potentially rally more than 31% from Monday's close.
