Learn More »\\n\\nDavid Becker\\n\\nThesis\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is scheduled to release its earnings report (\"ER\") on May 2, 2023 post-market. The ER will be for its FY Q1 ending March 2023. As a deeply cyclical stock, AMD has been facing strong headwinds in the past few quarters. For example, its client segment suffered a 51% year-over-year decline in sales last quarter (to $903 million). At the same time, the overall PC demand remains relatively soft.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, the thesis of this article is to preview its ER and explain why I am optimistic to see signs of the end of its contracting phase in the cycle. I will specifically focus on the following aspects:\\n\\nSigns for the end of margin contraction. AMD has suffered severe margin contraction in recent quarters. And I will explain why I think its margin has bottomed out already and is poised to expand. In the ER, I will pay special attention to data or management comments regarding this issue.\\n\\nSigns for improved assets turnover and execution. The chip cyclicality is causing a significant contraction in AMD\\'s asset utilization too. But again, I am optimistic that the contraction has also bottomed out. In particular, as the full potential of its Pensando and Xilinx acquisition gradually materializes, I expect to see further enhancement in asset turnover and execution efficiency.\\n\\nStrong financial strength. A strong financial position is key to survival in any cyclical business. In this regard, AMD stands out from other major chip makers like Intel Corporation (INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) with the strongest balance sheet. As such, I expect it to be the best positioned for a rebound once the contracting phase of the cycle is over.\\n\\n1: Margin contraction\\n\\nThe following chart displays the current profit margins of AMD in comparison to its close peers (INTC and NVDA). As seen, AMD\\'s profit margins are not the most outstanding. Its gross profit margin of 51.6% is lower than NVDA\\'s 56.9% by over 500 basis points. In terms of bottom-line margin, the comparison is even worse. AMD\\'s net profit margin of 5.6% falls substantially behind both INTC and NVDA, which are both in the mid-teens.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha\\n\\nThe following chart puts the above comparison under a broader historical perspective. AMD\\'s net profit turned positive around 2018 and since then, its margin has continued to expand, reaching a peak of ~50% in 2021, surpassing both INTC and NVDA. However, due to the macroscopic headwinds mentioned above, the margins of all three players have dramatically contracted. And AMD\\'s contraction is the most dramatic one (making it the most cyclical stock in this group in this regard). I believe there is a fundamental reason for it. AMD\\'s margin relies substantially on its high Average Selling Prices (\"ASP\") products as its high-end RyzenTM processors. And high-end products usually respond more sensitively.\\n\\nLooking forward, I expect to see signs of the end of the contraction in the upcoming ER. In particular, the following are the specific signs that I expect to see. And I will listen closely for management\\'s comments and data that either confirm or contradicts my expectations:\\n\\nThe uncertainty pertaining to the general macro environment should have eased by this time. And I expect that overall demand for the company\\'s products will start to normalize.\\n\\nThe substantial inventory buildup across the industry has largely been digested by now. As seen in the chart below, NVDA\\'s margin has already started expansion in the past quarter. As such, I expect a more favorable pricing environment for AMD\\'s products as well, especially its high-end CPUs and graphic processing units.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha\\n\\n2: Asset utilization and execution\\n\\nBesides margin pressure, AMD also suffered on the execution efficiency front in recent quarters as shown in the next chart. Its asset turnover rate (\"ATR\"), or asset utilization rate, used to be at the 1.5x level, more than 2x higher than NVDA and INTC. However, its ATR has taken a nose-dive since 2022 to the current level of 0.41x. Admittedly, INTC and NVDA\\'s ATR have also suffered a contraction, but to a much milder degree.\\n\\nLooking forward, I also expect to see signs of improving ATR in the upcoming ER. In particular, I will focus on management\\'s comments on the progress of its Pensando and Xilinx integration and also the business prospects of its Embedded and Data Center segments.\\n\\nI expect to hear positive comments on the Embedded and Data Center segment. The segments have performed exceptionally well even during the contracting phase of the cycle. And I expect its pace of expansion to be accelerated by the recent acquisition of Pensando and Xilinx. Both acquisitions are highly accretive in my view. I expect them to add diversified revenue streams, enable differentiated solutions for heterogeneous computing, and ultimately expanded AMD\\'s addressable market across key segments including data centers, communications, and embedded markets.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha\\n\\n3: Capital allocation\\n\\nIn any cyclical industry, maintaining a strong financial position is crucial. And AMD certainly has a superb balance sheet as shown in the chart below. To wit, it has $5.8 billion of total cash on hand, equivalent to $3 per share. At the same time, it has less than $3 billion in total debt. As such, AMD has a net cash position of about $2.9 billion. In contrast, NVDA and INTC (particularly INTC) have much lower liquidity and higher debts. In terms of Debt/Equity ratio, AMD\\'s ratio sits at only 5.4%, compared to 54% for NVDA and 41% for INTC.\\n\\nThis financial strength provides AMD with greater flexibility to allocate capital during the downturn and puts it in the best position to expand when the downturn is over. The capital allocation flexibility also gives the board the option to repurchase shares at strategic times, providing a boost to shareholder returns in the long term, as to be detailed next.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha\\n\\nRisks, valuation, and final thoughts\\n\\nThere are certainly many uncertainties and risks facing AMD. And just to be clear, my above analyses are what I EXPECT to see during the upcoming ER. And the actual data may contradict my expectation. Besides the generic uncertainties associated with ER preview, AMD\\'s current P/E is not cheap and entails some valuation risks. As seen, the stock is priced at an FY1 P/E of 27.6x, and it\\'s by no means cheap. To apply Peter Lynch\\'s rule of 1x PEG as a rule of thumb, such a P/E is justifiable if the growth rate is higher than 27.6%. But the projected growth rate is only at 21% CAGR as seen according to the consensus estimates.\\n\\nAuthor based on Seeking Alpha data\\n\\nHowever, in AMD\\'s case, my overall conclusion is that its investors do not need (and should not expect) hyper-growth to enjoy a healthy return. As shown by my projections in the chart above, based on the 21% CAGR consensus estimates project and even assuming a P/E contraction of 10% per year (corresponding to a contraction to 20x P/E in 3 years from its current level), the stock could still deliver an annual return of 15%, or 52% in total thanks to its robust growth and capital allocation flexibility.\\n\\nAs just mentioned, AMD\\'s financial strength provides it with the option to repurchase shares at strategic times. And in my view, that is exactly what its board has done as seen in the chart below. It has repurchased a substantial amount of its stock (more than $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2022 alone) when its valuations were very compressed. I expect such repurchases to continue and add a boost to shareholder returns. Management\\'s repurchase plans will be the final area I would listen closely to during the ER, which provides insights regarding the company\\'s cash flows and also its view on the valuation of its own stocks.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha data\\n\\nAs you can tell, our core style is to provide actionable and unambiguous ideas from our independent research.

We love hearing from you.\\n\\nLet\\'s get into the interview. So let\\'s dive right in nitty-gritty, huge week for markets this week. I mean, we could talk about the Fed. We could talk about earnings. Let\\'s actually start with the Fed. I mean, we\\'ve got the Fed meeting coming up next week. 25 basis points are on the docket. What\\'s your approach? What are you feeling about this?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, I\\'ve been tracking it closely. This is supposed to be the third rate hike of the year. And that\\'s what Chairman Powell promised for us last year. So it\\'ll be interesting if this will be the last rate hike for the year. And typically, and we discuss this a lot in our chat rooms, it\\'s not the rate hikes that lead to the market correction, but it\\'s the leveling off period.\\n\\nAnd we get a period where they hold it higher for longer that tends to lead to a downturn historically. And this particular series of rate hikes has been the steepest one that we\\'ve seen since 1977, and it usually doesn\\'t end very well when the tightening goes on like this for the banks and for lenders and borrowers that really need the cash flow.\\n\\nSo we\\'re watching a tightening effect happen here and it\\'s combined with QT, the Quantitative Tightening, it\\'s making it a little bit challenging for the markets and the money flows. And then one of the third, I would say, the third key element, I watch fund flows very closely. And what we\\'re seeing is that corporate buybacks are dropping in the sharpest three quarter decline of corporate buybacks since 2008.\\n\\nSo when we see these outflows and these tightenings occurring, it\\'s giving me some warning signals. And those warning signals are things that I wrote up in the Seeking Alpha competition to sort of guess where the market would end at the end of the year. And I have a target of 30 to 40 ((Ph)) for the S&P 500, but I don\\'t consider myself any great forecaster of the year ahead. There\\'s just too much that we can\\'t predict.\\n\\nSo, those are some targets I\\'m looking for. The main thing that I\\'m seeing is a distortion this year in the FAANG stocks. And what I mean by that is we\\'re seeing a very large crowding into, say, the top 5 or the top 10 largest market cap stocks in the S&P 500 Index. And what that does is it gives us a very low VIX Volatility Index and people are saying, I\\'ve seen a lot of articles out there saying that, \"Oh, look, the VIX is broken. It no longer works.\"\\n\\nBut what I think is actually happening, and this is my working theory that I kick around with a lot of members in the community, is that this crowding into the largest cap stocks is offsetting a lot of the smaller cap stocks that are hard hit. And we\\'ve seen, I think, I saw somewhere that the 10 largest NASDAQ stocks have accounted for 88% of the gains in the NASDAQ. And at some point, that could burst. So I\\'m playing a cautious swings using the momentum gauges this year.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: So how are you positioning for the pullback in the market this year?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, like I said, I don\\'t claim to know what the future holds, but I rely on a system that I developed in my doctoral research, which was the momentum gauges. And basically, they are forecast of money flows and they help me see where investors and large institutional traders are moving their money. And so in a way I\\'m a fast follower, and it\\'s really worked out well that we\\'ve never missed a major downturn.\\n\\nAnd just to give a in a nutshell how the momentum gauges work. After 30 years of trading, I thought, you know what, there\\'s so many models out there that are forecasting price change using price change whether that\\'s Bollinger Bands or Elliott Wave theory or technical analysis, they\\'re very heavy emphasis on prices.\\n\\nAnd what that creates is a momentum hoarding or herding effect, where people just chase stocks going up, and they react to just price movements. And I thought, why don\\'t I study variables other than price change to forecast price change? And so, long story short, I tested over 75 variables, back tested it to 20 years with a team of advisors and educators that helped me.\\n\\nBut what we found was there are key variables that can explain upwards of 74%, 75% of market direction without using price change to forecast price change, and that\\'s where the momentum gauges came into play. And that the term momentum is a little bit misleading because it\\'s not just the price momentum movement, but it\\'s actually looking at fundamental variables, behavioral variables, and technical variables, and it pulls on which ones are the best.\\n\\nAnd over time, I\\'ve - members of my community have encouraged me to break out momentum gauges for sectors, for the S&P 500 (SP500), for the overall market. I look at 7,500 stocks and see how that direction, that money flows is heading. And currently, as we start this very busy week of earnings, I think, there\\'s 576 stocks reporting this week. We started a negative signal. And last week, I\\'ve been in bear funds going into this week.\\n\\nSo that\\'s kind of how I do it. I don\\'t pretend to know what the future holds, but I follow the major flows and it hasn\\'t done us any - had any problems yet. So we\\'ll continue to, especially in this very volatile year, there\\'s a lot of chop and the folks that aren\\'t using timing indicators, they\\'re finding that they\\'re just getting pummeled and swung back and forth. And I think it\\'s very helpful to have indicators when you have this many reversals in the market.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: So you have this systematic approach to the markets. What are the results so far?\\n\\nJD Henning: I\\'m happy to share that. As we\\'re talking, my active ETF portfolio is up over 14%. Last year, it beat the market by 34% in one of the worst markets since 2008. And I also have in addition to the active ETF, I have the momentum gauge ETF model, which just swings back and forth in a group of ETF funds following the momentum gauges.\\n\\nThe last signal we had 25% gains on the - on NAIL, the homebuilder fund. There was a buy on LABU, on the biotechs. So it just - it moves now and switches bull bear right now, like I said, we\\'re in a bear fund. And leading bear funds right now are the China YANG 3X Bear fund and BNKD or B N K D, which is the 3X Big Bank Index. I\\'m still pretty bearish on banks and semiconductors are also negative. And I think those are in a high overbought position led by very good stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA), AMD, but they\\'ve seen a lot of crowding in the first quarter.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: So you\\'re watching these ETFs, but you\\'re also diving into the indexes and individual stocks. And I think this tees it up pretty nicely for - you\\'re talking about the FAANGs. You\\'re talking about everybody overcrowding with the flows. It\\'s earnings season. This is the week. Everybody is looking at the top five. What are you expecting from them?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, I can\\'t predict what the earnings will be or the reactions will be, but the probabilities are pretty high that these stocks are priced to perfection. And when I look at a lot of different indicators, I see these say the five mega caps, the biggest stocks in the S&P, I see them priced to perfection with well above average price-earnings ratios and price to sales ratios. And I think that\\'s part of a safety trade that I\\'ve been monitoring for a while.\\n\\nAnd what I mean by that is I look at the number of times that the S&P 500 has swung more than 2% in a trading day. And what\\'s really fascinating is it\\'s alternating every years in very sizable differences from 2018. And 2018 was the last year we had Quantitative Tightening, and it spiked with a lot of events in that year. And then in 2019, it came down to very low volatility. And then, of course 2020, it spiked again with COVID, and we had a lot of daily swings over 2% on the S&P.\\n\\nAnd then again, 2021, it calmed down, it was very low. But 2022 went up to 45 events, over 2%, which was one of the highest volatile years that we\\'ve had since the financial crisis. And yet, like this is the - my point is that we\\'re extremely low. We\\'ve only had two events greater than 2% on the S&P this year. And when - last year, we were having four of these events a month. Here, we are into the fourth month of the year with only two of them.\\n\\nAnd the only way I can explain the so-called low volatility even though the market is swinging, is that people are packing. And I say people, it\\'s hedge funds, investors, retirement funds and institutional investors, are really overcrowding these large FAANG stocks, which keep volatility low and cause people to think that the VIX is dead.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: Low volatility, yields are climbing in the bond market. Money managers have to keep their keep. So why shouldn\\'t investors just keep piling into the FAANG stocks?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, that\\'s a good question. And I think one of the reasons is that the banks, number one, they suffered a little bit of a run on some of the small banks and it scared the small bank investors. And we saw something that was kind of a too big to fail move where the small investors changed their deposits over to the big banks, and the big banks saw tremendous gain of new investors or new accounts, but that\\'s not the kind of organic growth that you want to see in financial sector. That\\'s the kind of herding for fear, which is similar to what we\\'re seeing in the FAANG mega caps.\\n\\nSo when I see people herding into the biggest banks, that\\'s a smart move for safety, but it\\'s not a sign of a healthy market. And then related to that, there\\'s a lot of discussion about the commercial real estate loans that are coming due in the large amounts. And because we\\'ve had the steepest rate hike since 1977, we\\'re seeing people looking at almost 5% increases on their loans that they have to refinance and year-over-year, and that\\'s just a shock to the budget for a lot of these companies.\\n\\nAnd I was just reading the other day that the companies that have started construction loans usually, the construction loan is a higher rate than the 30-year mortgage. But they\\'re finding that the construction loan that they started with is a better rate around 4% and they\\'re extending those loans out to four and five years and hoping that the 30-year drops again, so that they can kind of afford it with their budget.\\n\\nBut there\\'s a lot of indicators out there with commercial real estate going vacant in the cities, not a lot of foot traffic, a lot more online activity, and a lot of this is just COVID changed some behaviors. So you combine that with higher interest rates and tighter margins and outflows from the market and fewer corporate buybacks and quantitative tightening, and it makes for a challenging market for a lot of these businesses to sustain their share price.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: I was just looking at the Russell 2000. I mean, it\\'s still up 1.5% year-to-date. I think S&P 500 is up 8% as the time of recording this. They\\'re both positive. It seems like are we in a tale of two economies? Or is this just too much fear mongering? What\\'s the take here?\\n\\nJD Henning: Good question. This is something I kick around in my investment community. We\\'ve got a lot of really bright people there, and I lean on them for ideas and things that they\\'ve come across in the market. I think, and some of them have noticed this that there\\'s some similarities to the 2021 chop.\\n\\nAnd what I mean chop is that the indexes are staying relatively positive, but under the surface, we\\'re seeing very high sector turnover and a lot of rotation. And that rotation is basically people chasing from one sector to another looking for gains, they\\'re looking for green shoots. And every time something goes up, they all rush over to that and you see other sectors go down. And it\\'s kind of causing this swirling effect where the markets look good on top, like you said, the S&P 500 is positive, the Russell is not so bad.\\n\\nBut below the surface, the sectors are just every week, a leader, a lagger, a leader, a lagger, and the investors are kind of getting beaten up by it. And so that\\'s where again, the timing indicators matter. It\\'s very important to look at the sector gauges.\\n\\nAnd one of the most important sector gauges that I use in my momentum model is the technology sector gauge, because it\\'s - the technology sector by far is the largest sector in the marketplace. You\\'ve got three stocks there that are larger than four other sectors in the S&P 500. So, as a bellwether, it\\'s been negative for April. Even though other sectors are moving higher, it\\'s been giving me a warning signal into April after a really nice run in March.\\n\\nAnd so I\\'ve just been sitting on Bear funds kind of like FNGD, and BERZ, B-E-R-Z; and then like you said, I\\'ve been looking at some of the Russell small caps. We had some good gains in the biotech sector, which is a really fund small cap sector that can have great gains in short periods of time. And a lot of those stocks make it onto my weekly MDA breakout lists.\\n\\nAnd I can tell you that the weekly MDA breakouts, they\\'re up over 50% this year on weekly selections. It\\'s not a standard portfolio, but every week, I\\'m picking four new stocks for members, and they continue to get double-digit returns. Last week, IMCR got - gave us 16.5% returns in a week. A week before that, we had BBW, the Build-A-Bear Workshop, they - a good defensive stock, gained 10.4%. A week before that, ATEX 11.6%.\\n\\nSo we just have a pretty consistent gains with weekly breakouts, but you have to be careful not trading against the negative momentum conditions, because we are seeing the outflows. And related to that, when I said the similarities to 2021 were being observed by many of our members, that chop was when we got our biggest monthly negative signal in November, late November of 2021, and it didn\\'t turn positive for 9 months.\\n\\nSo we - following the monthly momentum gauges, we could\\'ve avoided all of 2022, but we stay also with the weekly to look for any bear bounces and get opportunities on the way. So there\\'s a lot of ways to trade it, there\\'s a lot of ways to use the gauges. But I suspect come about August, we could start seeing a little bit more weakness in the market, a little more chop and potentially another leg down as this choppiness starts to settle on a direction.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: So, say, I\\'m a long only investor. What sectors should I be focusing on right now?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, that\\'s a good question because, again, I don\\'t try and forecast way out. I do what I call conditional monitoring and I look for money flows to sustain for as long as possible in different sectors. One of the sectors that has a lot of potential is the basic materials sector. There\\'s a lot of talk about the U.S. dollar weakening and moving further into decline and maybe moving away from being a reserve currency, I don\\'t know about all that speculation.\\n\\nBut I do know that as the dollar weakens, it\\'s great for gold, it\\'s great for silver, typically helps oil and many other commodities that are priced in dollars. And so maybe even if the demand for oil is slipping, the decline of the dollar will continue to keep the price higher. So there\\'s a lot of factors in play, but basic materials is a pretty strong and solid long-term move if the market continues lower.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: So JD, let\\'s take it back a second talking about the VIX, the Volatility Index. A lot of people have been looking at it. It\\'s been sub-20 for a while now. Most people looked at it as a sell at 20, buy over 30, that was kind of the game plan for last year, if you will, is the mix broken now. What\\'s the take here? What do investors not know or think about of the VIX at these moments?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, yeah, we touched a little bit on that. I think it\\'s the overcrowding into some of the biggest FAANG stocks. It\\'s causing a dampening effect in the VIX, because the VIX is based on derivatives of options of the S&P 500. And close to 25% of the S&P 500 capitalization is found in those five largest stocks. So they can really dampen volatility. And I\\'m frankly surprised that we\\'ve only had two moves in the S&P this year greater than 2%. And I think that\\'s well below average of what I\\'ve been tracking.\\n\\nSo I expect sometime later in this year that we\\'re going to see a reversion to the mean where it\\'s going to pick up and we\\'re going to see a lot more VIX movement. I don\\'t think that the VIX trade is done or it\\'s dead by any means. I also think that it\\'s probably going to happen around the August timeframe because there\\'s a lot of things converging. We have the debt ceiling standoff going on. They\\'re just talking about forecast, I think, someone from Goldman said that the treasury would essentially run out of cash in late August that they would need some sort of agreement for a CR or a budget resolution.\\n\\nBut that also corresponds to the Fed\\'s target that they - Chairman Powell said in March of last year that they were going to reduce the balance sheet by a $1 trillion. And that was tracking at about, I think, $90 billion a month. The trajectory that they\\'re on right now is that it would be around the end of August that it hit the $1 trillion balance sheet level, and the Fed hasn\\'t - it hasn\\'t pivoted from that.\\n\\nAnd I think the banks did see a rescue. I think it was about $400 billion in emergency loans that they could access, but that was mostly to prevent a run on the banks that that consumers knew that they were backed up. But what it - it doesn\\'t address is the emergency loan program is different than the quantitative tightening program, which is - it\\'s the open market action for domestic securities.\\n\\nAnd I - from all my studies of QT that it\\'s actually the Fed investing in domestic securities that has a bigger impact on the markets. The emergency loan tends to be more isolated for the banks, and because the Fed is still reducing to a $1 trillion off the balance sheet, I think, that there\\'s going to be another issue, I say another because this is a similar program as 2018, and then we saw a big drop in Q4. And it wasn\\'t until December of 2018 that the Fed had to give up entirely on QT, and they cut rates, they stopped tightening, and the markets recovered.\\n\\nAnd in that sense we have a similar pattern evolving towards the August inflection point. But the big difference is, of course, inflation, and they keep insisting they\\'re going to hit their 2% inflation target. And I think that\\'s debatable. That\\'s going to be a real challenge because inflation is going to be sticky. It doesn\\'t come down as quickly as we would like.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: Before we get out of here, I can\\'t thank you enough for your time today, but I got to ask you, there\\'s the rounds going of how you and your investing group got out of Tesla, didn\\'t take any positions really before Tesla earnings. We saw the massive 10% drop. What - can you walk us through, like, what happened kind of in real-time? Was it the momentum gauges? What was the insights there that you saw ahead of time?\\n\\nJD Henning: Oh, yeah, I\\'d be happy to go into that. There\\'s a series of variables that I look at related to money flows, and some of them are technical and some of them are behavioral. And what I basically saw and this comes out of the momentum gauge model, I pull out a few variables that I can use in real-time just to check how stocks are doing rather than running a whole MDA analysis on, say, Tesla.\\n\\nAnd what I saw at the beginning of April was that some of these indicators, like, I use MFI indicator, which is a Money Flow Index. You can also use, I think, it\\'s Chaikin Money Flow Oscillator. There\\'s a lot of proxy indicators for money flow. And it was dropping pretty sharply and it turned negative. It was showing outflows really into the second day of April, and that was a first warning sign for me.\\n\\nAnd then I apply whatever models can work, and I found that technical analysis has some value. And I saw that it was breaking support levels around 188, and combined with continued market outflows, continued with losing its technical support level, it was just at a higher risk. And so I was telling people, let\\'s be cautious. None of these models are foolproof. But when you use the probabilities to your side, sometimes you really avoid some painful experiences.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: Yeah. Really incredible what you did there with the group and the team. All right. Let\\'s go ahead. And before we end the episode, if people want to get more of your data, your momentum index looks, your weekly picks, the four weekly picks you talked about, where can people find you?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, I\\'m on Seeking Alpha, JD Henning. And the name of my service is Value and Momentum Breakouts. You can find me on Twitter and a lot of other locations. And I\\'m - I try and stay very engaged with my members. We have a fantastic community. I\\'m really proud of the people that have signed up and the dialogue that we have.

The aforementioned stocks dominated first-quarter performance, with those seven stocks accounting for over 80% of the S&P 500 Index’s Q1 gains. Some market commentators noted the ‘narrow leadership’ of the group as a troubling indicator for future returns, citing the lack of broad participation in the rally.\\n\\nbanking crisis relative to ongoing inflationary concerns. The widely followed CBOE Volatility Index (the “VIX”) soared above 30 during March as investors braced for a potential banking crisis following the collapse of US regional banks SVB Financial Group (\\n\\nOTC:SIVBQ\\n\\n) (formerly NASDAQ:SIVB) and Signature Bank (NASDAQ:\\n\\nOTC:SBNY\\n\\n), followed by the fall of Credit Suisse Group AG (\\n\\nCS\\n\\n) (SW: CSGN). SIVB, the country's 16th-largest bank by assets and the preferred bank for many technology and venture-backed start-ups, experienced a classic ‘bank-run’ triggered by depositors who rushed to withdraw funds amidst growing anxiety about the bank’s solvency. New York-based SBNY, which focused its activities on the cryptocurrency segment in recent years, fell days later as investors lost confidence and initiated a run on deposits. SIVB and SBNY were subsequently taken over by federal regulators and mark the second and third largest bank failures in US history, trailing Washington Mutual, which collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.\\n\\nThe sudden collapse of SIVB and SBNY led many to fear contagion may spread across the broader domestic banking ecosystem. Social media fearmongering proliferated, with some highly followed online commentators disparaging fractional reserve banking and suggesting the entire system was ‘technically bankrupt.’ On Sunday evening, March 12, the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve (the “Fed”), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (“FDIC”) jointly sought to calm investor anxieties by announcing the government would invoke the “systemic risk exception” and would back SIVB and SBNY customer deposits beyond the federally insured ceiling of $250,000. Calls for the Fed to pause their interest rate hiking program escalated while some market commentators insisted an interest rate ‘cut’ was now required to stave off a potential banking crisis.\\n\\nThe Fed chose to ‘stay the course,’ raising its target rate by 25bps during its March 22nd meeting. Following the Fed meeting, Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse Group AG collapsed, forcing Swiss regulators to broker a fire-sale of the storied firm to rival UBS Group AG (UBS) (SW: UBSG) for CHF $3B. Continued stress in the banking sector contributed to a dramatic repricing of expectations of forward interest rates. At the start of the Period, investor expectations were for the Federal Funds rate to approach 5% through Q3 2023; however, within 10 days of the initial SIVB crisis, expectations were revised lower by over 75 bps. By the Period’s end, forward rate expectations rebounded; however, they remain well off their highs, forecasting interest rate cuts in the months ahead.\\n\\nThe BUZZ NextGen AI US Sentiment Leaders Index (the “BUZZ Index” or “Index”) returned 5.16% during the month of March compared to a return of 3.67% for the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Year-to-date, the BUZZ Index leads the S&P 500 with returns of 22.76% and 7.50%, respectively, as of the end of March.\\n\\nFed Funds Rate: Forward Expectations\\n\\nSource: Bloomberg.\\n\\nShares of GameStop Corp. Pace Advancing Stocks within the BUZZ Index\\n\\nShares of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) paced advancing stocks within the BUZZ Index during the recent Period. Viewed by many as the original ‘meme’ stock, GME surprised some investors with a strong fourth-quarter earnings report which showed the company’s cost reduction plan was progressing while both revenues and earnings exceeded analyst expectations. GME surged by over 35% on the day of the earnings release and gained 28.7% during the Period. Very few traditional analysts cover GME (likely due to its continued perception as a ‘meme’ stock) with no “buy” recommendations for the company before the earnings release, one firm rating the stock a “hold” and two firms rating the stock a “sell.”\\n\\nTop BUZZ Index Contributors: March 9, 2023 – April 13, 2023  Company Ticker Average Weight (%) Return Contribution (%)   GameStop Corp GME 3.38 0.85   Meta Platforms Inc META 3.30 0.68   Coinbase Global Inc COIN 3.31 0.61   Alphabet Inc GOOGL 3.22 0.50   Intel Corp INTC 2.06 0.46   Microsoft Corp MSFT 2.98 0.44   Nvidia Corp NVDA 3.31 0.43   Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD 3.15 0.35   Amazon.com Inc AMZN 3.11 0.34   Palantir Technologies Inc PLTR 2.97 0.33   Click to enlarge\\n\\nSource: BUZZ Holdings ULC, Bloomberg.

(NYSE:SQ), accusing the digital payments company of inflating user metrics and intentionally ignoring fraudulent activity on its platform. Recall Hindenburg was the research firm that recently published allegations of fraud against India-based conglomerate Adani Enterprises (IN: ADE), which led to a 70% decline in ADE’s stock price. To some market observers, the ADE report bolstered Hindenburg's credibility in the industry. Hindenburg claimed Block disregarded AML/KYC laws in its efforts to report growth at the company, citing interviews with former employees which exposed a poor regulatory culture at the company. Block’s stock declined nearly 15% on March 24th, the day Hindenburg released its report, and subsequently traded within a narrow range. Despite the controversy, investor sentiment appears to disagree with the accusations featured in Hindenburg's report, as positive investor sentiment has increased following its release. This month, SQ’s stock weight in the BUZZ Index rose from 1.45% to 2.96%.\\n\\nBlock Stock Price | January 2021 – April 2023\\n\\nSource: BUZZ Holdings ULC, Bloomberg.

The shock announcement by SVB Financial Group (formerly NASDAQ: SIVB) regarding its liquidity issues precipitated massive withdrawals of deposits. This classic bank run left the bank on the brink of insolvency. The rapid pace of interest rate increases over the past year, coupled with a sudden loss of deposits, exposed the vulnerabilities in SIVB’s mismanaged bond portfolio and put the spotlight on other regional banks facing similar risks. To restore confidence, the Federal Reserve and CDIC acted swiftly to effectively safeguard deposit structures within the country, quickly quelling the crisis. Many bank stocks plummeted initially before recouping some of the losses as the situation improved. This month, the BUZZ Index contains 17 financials stocks, including regional and niche banks such as New York Community Bancorp (NYSE:NYCB) and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), bringing the total weight of the sector within the Index to 27%. The jump in the financials weight is the biggest ever for the Index. Increasing positive investor sentiment may suggest that many bank stocks will continue to recover from the latest banking crisis.\\n\\nImportant Definitions and Disclosures CBOE Volatility Index (VIX): An index created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), which shows the market's expectation of 30-day volatility.

Learn More »\\n\\nMichael Vi\\n\\nNASDAQ:ASML) is probably one of the most important companies in the world right now. The chips that Taiwan Semiconductor\\n\\nManufacturing Company Limited (\\n\\nTSM\\n\\n) produces for companies such as Apple Inc. (\\n\\nAAPL\\n\\n), Nvidia Corporation (\\n\\nNVDA\\n\\n), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (\\n\\nAMD\\n\\n), and even Intel Corporation (\\n\\nINTC\\n\\n) are made with the help of EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography) machines that were pioneered by the Dutch industrial conglomerate ASML who now has a monopoly over the semiconductor lithography market.\\n\\nAs such, it's no surprise that the company has been at the center of attention in recent months. The Biden administration has been increasing pressure on its allies and the Netherlands in particular to prohibit sales of advanced semiconductor machines to China to diminish Beijing's capabilities to create advanced chips that could be used for military purposes. Earlier this year, the Biden administration finally managed to strike a deal with the Dutch officials to prohibit sales of some immersion lithography gear to China, which could have a direct impact on ASML performance in the future.\\n\\nConsidering this, it makes sense to highlight ASML's recent performance, figure out what parts of its business are likely to be affected the most after the recent deal, and conclude whether its stock is still a worthy investment in the current environment of heightened geopolitical risks.\\n\\nIs The ASML Growth Story Far From Over?\\n\\nIf we take geopolitics aside for the moment and look at ASML's recent earnings report for Q1 that was published earlier this month, we'll see that despite all the fearmongering that Europe is going to deindustrialize due to high energy prices the opposite has happened, and the Dutch semiconductor giant has delivered a stellar performance. ASML's revenue in the first quarter was up 91.4% Y/Y to €6.7 billion as its gross margin stood at 50.6% while its net income was €2 billion. The company was able to deliver such great results mostly thanks to the high demand for its unique EUV and deep UV machines.\\n\\nWhat's also important to note is that ASML's management has noted that the business would continue to grow at an aggressive rate, and in Q2 its sales are expected to be in the range of €7 billion. As such, it's safe to say that ASML's growth story is far from over, especially since its backlog at the end of March stood at almost €39 billion, which is almost two times its expected 2023 sales.\\n\\nOn top of that, there's also an indication that the demand for its EUV and other tools would remain strong in the following years as major fabs that are run by companies such as TSMC and Samsung are continuing to develop 2nm chips that should be ready for mass production by 2025. Thanks to this, it's likely that if ASML continues to aggressively grow its sales as it did in the previous couple of quarters, then it has all the chances of reaching €30 billion to €40 billion in annual sales by 2025 per its calculations that were presented at the end of last year.\\n\\nConsidering all of this, the Street continues to be bullish on the company's future despite all the macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. It believes that ASML's stock has a 30% upside from the current levels, as its sales and profits are expected to increase annually at the aggressive double-digit rate in the following years. However, since the stock already trades at nearly 9 times its forward sales while its forward P/E is over 30x, ASML might not be a good fit for value investors who like to minimize risks as much as possible. But if ASML's business continues to aggressively grow at the forecasted rates while the changing geopolitical landscape won't disrupt its operations much, then there's a case to be made that the upside is reasonable given the company's monopoly over the semiconductor lithography market.\\n\\nASML's Consensus Price Target (Seeking Alpha)\\n\\nThe Changing Geopolitical Landscape\\n\\nLast year, the Biden administration began to actively impose various restrictions on trade with China as a part of the broader trade war policy that started under the Trump administration back in 2018 and is still ongoing. The most prominent were restrictions on exporting highly advanced chips, such as Nvidia's A100 GPUs that are used for various AI-related infrastructure.\\n\\nAt the same time, at the beginning of this year, the Biden administration began talks with its Dutch and Japanese counterparts to impose stricter export controls on a wide set of lithography tools that are manufactured by companies such as ASML. As noted earlier in this article, at the end of January, the Netherlands sided with the United States and imposed similar export restrictions on lithography tools to China. At the same time, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in March wrote an op-ed in which he argued that those export restrictions would help the country and its companies to better protect their intellectual property and not lose their technological edge to adversaries.\\n\\nEven though those restrictions on paper would limit ASML's ability to work with its Chinese customers, the reality is that the company itself began to diversify its operations a couple of years ago and has been gradually decreasing its exposure to China. As such, it's questionable whether those restrictions will severely affect its operations anytime soon. If we look at the pie chart below, we'll see a year ago, China accounted for 34% of ASML's sales in Q1'22.\\n\\nASML's Sales Breakdown (ASML)\\n\\nHowever, the latest data from Q1'23 shows that the exposure to China has decreased to 8% in a single year, primarily thanks to the major increase in sales of ASML's EUV machines that are expected to remain in high demand and outweigh the potential loss of a major portion of the Chinese market.\\n\\nASML's Sales Breakdown (ASML)\\n\\nConsidering this, it's safe to assume that the export restrictions on lithography tools that the U.S. and Dutch governments imposed earlier this year won't significantly affect ASML's operations anytime soon, especially if we consider that in Q1 the company delivered solid returns while significantly decreasing its exposure to China at the same time.\\n\\nHowever, the real problem for ASML is that it replaced the Chinese market primarily thanks to major new orders from Taiwanese TSMC, which produces ~90% of most advanced processors using the machines of the Dutch company. The problem with this is that in the current era of heightened geopolitical risks, there's constantly a possibility that Beijing decides to invade the island nation, which could lead to ASML losing its major client and a significant chunk of future sales.\\n\\nHowever, the good news is that if Beijing sticks to the status quo in the following years, then there's a solid chance that ASML would be able to greatly minimize its geopolitical risks. That's because in addition to export restrictions to China, the Western countries began to implement various programs that aim to move the production of semiconductors back home using taxpayer funds. The United States is about to begin distributing $280 billion in funding for new fabs and R&D centers on its soil this year, while the European Union recently approved the €43 billion deal to boost semiconductor production in Europe.\\n\\nThanks to this, ASML is also going to greatly benefit from all of those programs as companies like TSMC, Intel and Samsung already announced new plans to build new fabs on American and European soil and would use ASML's EUV machines to build their chips there. TSMC already plans to manufacture 3nm chips for Apple and others on its new Arizona plant in 2024, while Intel itself last year built the new Fab 34 in Ireland specifically for ASML's EUV machines to produce its latest Intel 4 chipset in the European Union. Therefore, if Taiwan's status quo is maintained in the following years, then there's every reason to believe that ASML would be able to greatly minimize its geopolitical risks, have no exposure to China, and continue to grow at an aggressive double-digit rate to reach its ambitious goals as the chip production moves West at the same time.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nASML Holding N.V.'s unchallenged leadership position in the semiconductor lithography market ensures that it will continue to be one of the most important companies in the world in the foreseeable future. Its recent solid earnings results show that the demand for its EUV machines and other tools would remain high for years to come as chipmakers are now actively using governmental subsidies to manufacture new fabs and bring production back to the U.S. and Europe.\\n\\nAt the same time, it seems that the latest export restrictions to China didn't have any major material impact on ASML's operations. If Beijing sticks to the status quo and doesn't invade Taiwan anytime soon, then the company would more than likely reach its long-term goals and more than double its annual sales in the following years. As a result of this, it's safe to say that ASML Holding N.V.'s premium price is justified and there's a case to be made that its shares have more room for growth even in the current era of heightened geopolitical risks as its business has become too important and too big to fail in the first place.\\n\\nEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Learn More »\\n\\nDavid Becker\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nSince my last update on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was published in September 2022, AMD\\'s stock has rallied by roughly 40% amid broad strength in semiconductor names. Six months ago, AMD\\'s technical setup looked ominous; however, I rated AMD a \"Buy\" at the time due to its robust long-term business prospects and depressed valuation. With the stock now trading close to its fair value, I think the risk/reward is far less favorable at current levels.\\n\\nAMD\\'s recent quarterly reports have been sub-par, with the company (and the semiconductor industry in general) grappling with a supply glut. With the economy seemingly headed toward a hard landing, AMD\\'s financial performance has probably not bottomed yet for this semiconductor cycle.\\n\\nConference Board\\n\\nSo far in 2023, AMD\\'s stock has rallied big time; however, investors should take a closer look at the company before joining the AMD bandwagon ahead of its Q1 report (expected on May 2 post-market). In today\\'s note, we shall preview AMD\\'s upcoming report and re-evaluate the stock using TQI\\'s Quantamental Analysis process to see if it\\'s a buy/sell/hold at current levels.\\n\\nWhat Is The Earnings Forecast For AMD?\\n\\nIn their Q4 2022 earning press release, AMD\\'s management guided for Q1 2023 revenues to be in the range of $5-$5.6B, and this guide fell short of consensus analyst estimates of $5.6B. Furthermore, the guide for non-GAAP EPS also fell short of estimates. However, Mr. Market reacted positively to AMD\\'s ER, with the stock jumping up +18% in just two post-earning sessions as investors seemingly looked beyond the immediate results and guidance.\\n\\nAMD Q4 2022 Presentation\\n\\nWell, that\\'s not all! AMD\\'s management had some good news for investors. From the Q1 earnings call transcript, I learned that AMD\\'s management sees macro headwinds lasting through the first half of this year; however, they see the demand environment improving in the back half of 2023, with emerging technologies like AI set to drive greater demand for AMD\\'s products for years to come.\\n\\nAMD Q4 2022 Earnings Transcript\\n\\nNow, AMD\\'s management has a history of under-promising and over-delivering, and so, we may very well end up with better-than-expected results from Advanced Micro Devices in 2023.\\n\\nAMD\\'s Earnings History (SeekingAlpha)\\n\\nIn my view, the secular trends powering AMD\\'s growth are going to remain strong for years to come. While its near-term financial performance is set to remain under pressure, AMD is gaining market share across all of its business segments in this tough macroeconomic environment. Unfortunately, negative growth rates are unlikely to go unpunished in this environment, and we could see another leg lower in AMD stock after its Q1 report, especially if AMD falls short of lowered consensus estimates.\\n\\nBefore we look into consensus analyst estimates for Q1 2023, let\\'s briefly review AMD\\'s Q4 2022 earnings report to understand ongoing business trends.\\n\\nHow Was AMD\\'s Previous Earning Report?\\n\\nIn Q4 2022, Advanced Micro Devices\\' revenues grew by 16% y/y to $5.6B, with growth in its Data Center and Embedded business segments being offset by Client and Gaming business lines. While AMD delivered a marginal beat on revenues, EPS fell short of expectations.\\n\\nSeekingAlpha\\n\\nAMD Q4 2022 Earnings Presentation\\n\\nAmid a sharp decline in global PC shipments, AMD has been under shipping in its Client business segment over recent quarters, which saw a 51% y/y drop in Q4 2022. For 2023, AMD is planning for the PC total addressable market (\"TAM\") to be down ~10% for 2023, with the second half of the year expected to be far better than the first half. According to IDC, global PC shipments fell by 29% y/y, with shipments being hurt by weak demand, excess inventory, and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions.\\n\\nNow, despite AMD\\'s business becoming data center centric over the last few quarters, AMD\\'s growth outlook remains challenging until the global PC market weakness persists. As economic strength wanes, AMD\\'s Gaming business has also come under pressure in recent quarters, and this trend continued in Q4 2022. For 2023, AMD\\'s management expects Client and Gaming segment revenue to decline for the full year 2023 due to lower demand.\\n\\nMore alarmingly, AMD\\'s management has expressed caution on the Data Center segment for H1 2023 due to some of its major cloud customers having high levels of inventories. In Q4 2022, AMD\\'s Data Center revenues were up 42% y/y, and this segment had been a key driver of growth for AMD throughout 2022. In addition to its Data Center segment, AMD\\'s Embedded business segment is showing strong growth; however, this growth is a result of AMD\\'s strategic acquisition of Xilinx. I\\'ll be keeping a close eye on the Embedded segment in the upcoming quarters to understand the real trajectory of this business.\\n\\nFor the last several years, AMD has been winning market share across its various end markets. And AMD is continually adding new and improved products across its segments, which means that the market share gains are likely to continue in the coming years. Among these innovations are AMD\\'s 4th Gen EPYC CPU processors, Ryzen 7040 CPU Series, Ryzen 7045 CPU Series, and RadeonTM RX 7900 series graphics cards.\\n\\nOn top of a sharp revenue growth deceleration, AMD\\'s financial performance is suffering under the weight of margin compression. With a supply glut forcing inventory write-offs among semiconductor companies in recent quarters, AMD\\'s margins have tumbled lower. In Q4, AMD\\'s non-GAAP operating margins came in at 23% (down 400 bps y/y).\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nThe company attributed the fall in the Client segment\\'s margin to lower revenue. However, the decline in Data Center margins was attributed to additional R&D and go-to-market investments to support the next phase of AMD\\'s revenue growth. In upcoming quarters, I hope to see an improvement in AMD\\'s margin profile; however, things are unlikely to get better until the macroeconomic environment eases off.\\n\\nWhen Does AMD Report Earnings? Is AMD Expected To Beat Earnings?\\n\\nAs we noted earlier, AMD\\'s earnings date is May 2, 2023, with numbers expected to be released in post-market hours. According to consensus analyst estimates, AMD is set to deliver total revenue of $5.31B for Q1 2023, and the range of these estimates is from $5.25B to $5.50B (higher end of management\\'s guidance for this quarter).\\n\\nSeekingAlpha\\n\\nSeekingAlpha\\n\\nOver the last three months, AMD has received 24 downward revisions for Q1 2023 revenue as analysts scamper to adjust to management\\'s lowered guidance. As of today, the consensus analyst estimate for AMD\\'s Q1 revenue sits at $5.31B (in line with the midpoint of management\\'s guidance range).\\n\\nSeekingAlpha\\n\\nSeekingAlpha\\n\\nThe consensus outlook for AMD\\'s revenue has been trending in the wrong direction over the last couple of quarters or so; however, the earnings outlook is getting markedly worse. That said, AMD is already a cash-generating machine, and with scale, profitability is only going to get better in the future. Based on recent business trends, management\\'s guidance, and earning revisions, I think AMD is not likely to deliver a beat on consensus expectations. And even if we do get a beat from AMD, the quantum of the beat may be minimal, and I am currently working with a Q1 2023 revenue projection of $5.3B (midpoint of management\\'s guidance).\\n\\nIs AMD Stock A Buy, Sell, or Hold?\\n\\nUsing conservative estimates in our proprietary valuation model, we determined that AMD stock is still slightly undervalued at current levels. As of now, our fair value estimate for AMD stands at ~$95 per share (including Q1 2023 estimates).\\n\\nTQI Valuation Model (TQIG.org)\\n\\nAssuming a base case P/FCF exit multiple of ~20x, we get to a 5-yr price target of ~$186 per share, which implies a CAGR return of ~16%.\\n\\nTQI Valuation Model (TQIG.org)\\n\\nSince AMD\\'s expected CAGR return is only marginally higher than my investment hurdle rate of 15%, the stock is not exactly tempting at current levels due to the lack of a significant margin of safety.\\n\\nTechnically, AMD\\'s chart looks far better than it did six months ago; however, the stock seems to be forming a rising wedge pattern, and a breakdown to the $72-80 range is likely, given the rollover in RSI, MACD, and trading volumes.\\n\\nWeBull Desktop\\n\\nFurthermore, AMD\\'s quant factor grades remain unsupportive for fresh buying despite its \"Momentum\" grade going from \"D\" to \"A\" over the last six months. While AMD\\'s \"Profitability\" and \"Growth\" grades have held up at \"A\" and \"B+,\" its \"Valuation\" and \"Revisions\" grades have deteriorated to \"D+\" and \"D\" during the same period.\\n\\nSeekingAlpha\\n\\nWhile AMD\\'s stock has continued to climb up in recent months, its earning estimates have been shifting lower. And I believe AMD\\'s quant factor grades are a fair reflection of this anomalous movement in its earnings expectations and stock price.\\n\\nHeading into a pivotal quarterly report, Wall Street analysts remain bullish on AMD stock, with nearly two-thirds of the analysts covering AMD rating the stock as a \"Buy or Strong Buy\" right now [and the rest rating it a \"Hold\"].\\n\\nSeekingAlpha\\n\\nInterestingly, there are no \"Sell\" ratings from Wall Street firms on AMD at this time. Yet, the upside potential that analysts are predicting from here isn\\'t huge. With a consensus analyst price target of $97.72, Wall Street sees an upside potential of just ~10% in AMD for the next 12-month period.\\n\\nConcluding Thoughts\\n\\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. remains a fundamentally sound business, and going into the Q1 2023 report, I continue to like it as a long-term investment. The company\\'s transition to being a data-center-centric business should enable it to remain far more resilient through an economic downturn compared to previous cycles. As we have seen in this note, AMD is gaining market share. And demand for AMD\\'s products is likely to grow rapidly over the coming years as ground-breaking, compute-intensive technologies such as generative AI come to markets.\\n\\nThat said, AMD is still grappling with oversupply-related issues, and the weakness seen in recent quarterly results may persist over the next few quarters. This is why I would like to sit back and observe AMD\\'s financial performance for a quarter or two to see how the business evolves through the current challenging macroeconomic environment.\\n\\nWith Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\\'s technical charts pointing to the $72-80 support range and near-term risk/reward at current levels not being attractive enough, I am skeptical about adding to my AMD position ahead of earnings. Hence, I am in wait-and-watch mode until the AMD Q1 earnings are out. If we do get an unlikely beat from AMD, I will reconsider my position, but until then, I am holding off on fresh buying here.\\n\\nKey Takeaway: I rate Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. stock \"Neutral/Hold\" at ~$88.4 per share.\\n\\nThank you for reading, and happy investing!

As seen, AMD's profit margins are not the most outstanding. Its gross profit margin of 51.6% is lower than NVDA's 56.9% by over 500 basis points.

However, due to the macroscopic headwinds mentioned above, the margins of all three players have dramatically contracted. And AMD\\'s contraction is the most dramatic one (making it the most cyclical stock in this group in this regard). I believe there is a fundamental reason for it. AMD\\'s margin relies substantially on its high Average Selling Prices (\"ASP\") products as its high-end RyzenTM processors. And high-end products usually respond more sensitively.\\n\\nLooking forward, I expect to see signs of the end of the contraction in the upcoming ER.

At the same time, it has less than $3 billion in total debt. As such, AMD has a net cash position of about $2.9 billion.

In terms of Debt/Equity ratio, AMD's ratio sits at only 5.4%, compared to 54% for NVDA and 41% for INTC.\\n\\nThis financial strength provides AMD with greater flexibility to allocate capital during the downturn and puts it in the best position to expand when the downturn is over. The capital allocation flexibility also gives the board the option to repurchase shares at strategic times, providing a boost to shareholder returns in the long term, as to be detailed next.\\n\\nSeeking Alpha\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ed6d1e2a5cfc0ea4e105ad58fa7d2ce84e676762d4d5441e7ab64745bab6ae2a'}),\n",

And just to be clear, my above analyses are what I EXPECT to see during the upcoming ER. And the actual data may contradict my expectation. Besides the generic uncertainties associated with ER preview, AMD's current P/E is not cheap and entails some valuation risks. As seen, the stock is priced at an FY1 P/E of 27.6x, and it's by no means cheap. To apply Peter Lynch's rule of 1x PEG as a rule of thumb, such a P/E is justifiable if the growth rate is higher than 27.6%. But the projected growth rate is only at 21% CAGR as seen according to the consensus estimates.\\n\\nAuthor based on Seeking Alpha data\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=ed6d1e2a5cfc0ea4e105ad58fa7d2ce84e676762d4d5441e7ab64745bab6ae2a'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"Let's get into the interview. So let's dive right in nitty-gritty, huge week for markets this week. I mean, we could talk about the Fed. We could talk about earnings. Let's actually start with the Fed. I mean, we've got the Fed meeting coming up next week. 25 basis points are on the docket. What's your approach? What are you feeling about this?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, I've been tracking it closely. This is supposed to be the third rate hike of the year. And that's what Chairman Powell promised for us last year. So it'll be interesting if this will be the last rate hike for the year. And typically, and we discuss this a lot in our chat rooms, it's not the rate hikes that lead to the market correction, but it's the leveling off period.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"And we get a period where they hold it higher for longer that tends to lead to a downturn historically. And this particular series of rate hikes has been the steepest one that we've seen since 1977, and it usually doesn't end very well when the tightening goes on like this for the banks and for lenders and borrowers that really need the cash flow.\\n\\nSo we're watching a tightening effect happen here and it's combined with QT, the Quantitative Tightening, it's making it a little bit challenging for the markets and the money flows. And then one of the third, I would say, the third key element, I watch fund flows very closely. And what we're seeing is that corporate buybacks are dropping in the sharpest three quarter decline of corporate buybacks since 2008.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='So when we see these outflows and these tightenings occurring, it\\'s giving me some warning signals. And those warning signals are things that I wrote up in the Seeking Alpha competition to sort of guess where the market would end at the end of the year. And I have a target of 30 to 40 ((Ph)) for the S&P 500, but I don\\'t consider myself any great forecaster of the year ahead. There\\'s just too much that we can\\'t predict.\\n\\nSo, those are some targets I\\'m looking for. The main thing that I\\'m seeing is a distortion this year in the FAANG stocks. And what I mean by that is we\\'re seeing a very large crowding into, say, the top 5 or the top 10 largest market cap stocks in the S&P 500 Index. And what that does is it gives us a very low VIX Volatility Index and people are saying, I\\'ve seen a lot of articles out there saying that, \"Oh, look, the VIX is broken. It no longer works.\"', metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"But what I think is actually happening, and this is my working theory that I kick around with a lot of members in the community, is that this crowding into the largest cap stocks is offsetting a lot of the smaller cap stocks that are hard hit. And we've seen, I think, I saw somewhere that the 10 largest NASDAQ stocks have accounted for 88% of the gains in the NASDAQ. And at some point, that could burst. So I'm playing a cautious swings using the momentum gauges this year.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: So how are you positioning for the pullback in the market this year?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, like I said, I don't claim to know what the future holds, but I rely on a system that I developed in my doctoral research, which was the momentum gauges. And basically, they are forecast of money flows and they help me see where investors and large institutional traders are moving their money. And so in a way I'm a fast follower, and it's really worked out well that we've never missed a major downturn.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"And just to give a in a nutshell how the momentum gauges work. After 30 years of trading, I thought, you know what, there's so many models out there that are forecasting price change using price change whether that's Bollinger Bands or Elliott Wave theory or technical analysis, they're very heavy emphasis on prices.\\n\\nAnd what that creates is a momentum hoarding or herding effect, where people just chase stocks going up, and they react to just price movements. And I thought, why don't I study variables other than price change to forecast price change? And so, long story short, I tested over 75 variables, back tested it to 20 years with a team of advisors and educators that helped me.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"But what we found was there are key variables that can explain upwards of 74%, 75% of market direction without using price change to forecast price change, and that's where the momentum gauges came into play. And that the term momentum is a little bit misleading because it's not just the price momentum movement, but it's actually looking at fundamental variables, behavioral variables, and technical variables, and it pulls on which ones are the best.\\n\\nAnd over time, I've - members of my community have encouraged me to break out momentum gauges for sectors, for the S&P 500 (SP500), for the overall market. I look at 7,500 stocks and see how that direction, that money flows is heading. And currently, as we start this very busy week of earnings, I think, there's 576 stocks reporting this week. We started a negative signal. And last week, I've been in bear funds going into this week.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"So that's kind of how I do it. I don't pretend to know what the future holds, but I follow the major flows and it hasn't done us any - had any problems yet. So we'll continue to, especially in this very volatile year, there's a lot of chop and the folks that aren't using timing indicators, they're finding that they're just getting pummeled and swung back and forth. And I think it's very helpful to have indicators when you have this many reversals in the market.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: So you have this systematic approach to the markets. What are the results so far?\\n\\nJD Henning: I'm happy to share that. As we're talking, my active ETF portfolio is up over 14%. Last year, it beat the market by 34% in one of the worst markets since 2008. And I also have in addition to the active ETF, I have the momentum gauge ETF model, which just swings back and forth in a group of ETF funds following the momentum gauges.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The last signal we had 25% gains on the - on NAIL, the homebuilder fund. There was a buy on LABU, on the biotechs. So it just - it moves now and switches bull bear right now, like I said, we're in a bear fund. And leading bear funds right now are the China YANG 3X Bear fund and BNKD or B N K D, which is the 3X Big Bank Index. I'm still pretty bearish on banks and semiconductors are also negative. And I think those are in a high overbought position led by very good stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA), AMD, but they've seen a lot of crowding in the first quarter.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: So you're watching these ETFs, but you're also diving into the indexes and individual stocks. And I think this tees it up pretty nicely for - you're talking about the FAANGs. You're talking about everybody overcrowding with the flows. It's earnings season. This is the week. Everybody is looking at the top five. What are you expecting from them?\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"JD Henning: Well, I can't predict what the earnings will be or the reactions will be, but the probabilities are pretty high that these stocks are priced to perfection. And when I look at a lot of different indicators, I see these say the five mega caps, the biggest stocks in the S&P, I see them priced to perfection with well above average price-earnings ratios and price to sales ratios. And I think that's part of a safety trade that I've been monitoring for a while.\\n\\nAnd what I mean by that is I look at the number of times that the S&P 500 has swung more than 2% in a trading day. And what's really fascinating is it's alternating every years in very sizable differences from 2018. And 2018 was the last year we had Quantitative Tightening, and it spiked with a lot of events in that year. And then in 2019, it came down to very low volatility. And then, of course 2020, it spiked again with COVID, and we had a lot of daily swings over 2% on the S&P.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"And then again, 2021, it calmed down, it was very low. But 2022 went up to 45 events, over 2%, which was one of the highest volatile years that we've had since the financial crisis. And yet, like this is the - my point is that we're extremely low. We've only had two events greater than 2% on the S&P this year. And when - last year, we were having four of these events a month. Here, we are into the fourth month of the year with only two of them.\\n\\nAnd the only way I can explain the so-called low volatility even though the market is swinging, is that people are packing. And I say people, it's hedge funds, investors, retirement funds and institutional investors, are really overcrowding these large FAANG stocks, which keep volatility low and cause people to think that the VIX is dead.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: Low volatility, yields are climbing in the bond market. Money managers have to keep their keep.

So why shouldn't investors just keep piling into the FAANG stocks?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, that's a good question. And I think one of the reasons is that the banks, number one, they suffered a little bit of a run on some of the small banks and it scared the small bank investors. And we saw something that was kind of a too big to fail move where the small investors changed their deposits over to the big banks, and the big banks saw tremendous gain of new investors or new accounts, but that's not the kind of organic growth that you want to see in financial sector. That's the kind of herding for fear, which is similar to what we're seeing in the FAANG mega caps.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"So when I see people herding into the biggest banks, that's a smart move for safety, but it's not a sign of a healthy market. And then related to that, there's a lot of discussion about the commercial real estate loans that are coming due in the large amounts. And because we've had the steepest rate hike since 1977, we're seeing people looking at almost 5% increases on their loans that they have to refinance and year-over-year, and that's just a shock to the budget for a lot of these companies.\\n\\nAnd I was just reading the other day that the companies that have started construction loans usually, the construction loan is a higher rate than the 30-year mortgage. But they're finding that the construction loan that they started with is a better rate around 4% and they're extending those loans out to four and five years and hoping that the 30-year drops again, so that they can kind of afford it with their budget.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",

So you combine that with higher interest rates and tighter margins and outflows from the market and fewer corporate buybacks and quantitative tightening, and it makes for a challenging market for a lot of these businesses to sustain their share price.\\n\\nDaniel Snyder: I was just looking at the Russell 2000. I mean, it's still up 1.5% year-to-date. I think S&P 500 is up 8% as the time of recording this. They're both positive. It seems like are we in a tale of two economies?

We've got a lot of really bright people there, and I lean on them for ideas and things that they've come across in the market. I think, and some of them have noticed this that there's some similarities to the 2021 chop.\\n\\nAnd what I mean chop is that the indexes are staying relatively positive, but under the surface, we're seeing very high sector turnover and a lot of rotation. And that rotation is basically people chasing from one sector to another looking for gains, they're looking for green shoots. And every time something goes up, they all rush over to that and you see other sectors go down. And it's kind of causing this swirling effect where the markets look good on top, like you said, the S&P 500 is positive, the Russell is not so bad.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"But below the surface, the sectors are just every week, a leader, a lagger, a leader, a lagger, and the investors are kind of getting beaten up by it. And so that's where again, the timing indicators matter. It's very important to look at the sector gauges.\\n\\nAnd one of the most important sector gauges that I use in my momentum model is the technology sector gauge, because it's - the technology sector by far is the largest sector in the marketplace. You've got three stocks there that are larger than four other sectors in the S&P 500. So, as a bellwether, it's been negative for April. Even though other sectors are moving higher, it's been giving me a warning signal into April after a really nice run in March.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",

We had some good gains in the biotech sector, which is a really fund small cap sector that can have great gains in short periods of time. And a lot of those stocks make it onto my weekly MDA breakout lists.\\n\\nAnd I can tell you that the weekly MDA breakouts, they're up over 50% this year on weekly selections.

I do what I call conditional monitoring and I look for money flows to sustain for as long as possible in different sectors. One of the sectors that has a lot of potential is the basic materials sector. There's a lot of talk about the U.S. dollar weakening and moving further into decline and maybe moving away from being a reserve currency, I don't know about all that speculation.\\n\\nBut I do know that as the dollar weakens, it's great for gold, it's great for silver, typically helps oil and many other commodities that are priced in dollars. And so maybe even if the demand for oil is slipping, the decline of the dollar will continue to keep the price higher. So there's a lot of factors in play, but basic materials is a pretty strong and solid long-term move if the market continues lower.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Daniel Snyder: So JD, let's take it back a second talking about the VIX, the Volatility Index. A lot of people have been looking at it. It's been sub-20 for a while now. Most people looked at it as a sell at 20, buy over 30, that was kind of the game plan for last year, if you will, is the mix broken now. What's the take here? What do investors not know or think about of the VIX at these moments?\\n\\nJD Henning: Well, yeah, we touched a little bit on that. I think it's the overcrowding into some of the biggest FAANG stocks. It's causing a dampening effect in the VIX, because the VIX is based on derivatives of options of the S&P 500. And close to 25% of the S&P 500 capitalization is found in those five largest stocks. So they can really dampen volatility. And I'm frankly surprised that we've only had two moves in the S&P this year greater than 2%.

We have the debt ceiling standoff going on. They're just talking about forecast, I think, someone from Goldman said that the treasury would essentially run out of cash in late August that they would need some sort of agreement for a CR or a budget resolution.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",

The trajectory that they're on right now is that it would be around the end of August that it hit the $1 trillion balance sheet level, and the Fed hasn't - it hasn't pivoted from that.\\n\\nAnd I think the banks did see a rescue. I think it was about $400 billion in emergency loans that they could access, but that was mostly to prevent a run on the banks that that consumers knew that they were backed up. But what it - it doesn't address is the emergency loan program is different than the quantitative tightening program, which is - it's the open market action for domestic securities.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=3132f6ee9588c752e156559bee28f801b359f4d604aa5f412adaa2f89b1dd099'}),\n",

The emergency loan tends to be more isolated for the banks, and because the Fed is still reducing to a $1 trillion off the balance sheet, I think, that there's going to be another issue, I say another because this is a similar program as 2018, and then we saw a big drop in Q4. And it wasn't until December of 2018 that the Fed had to give up entirely on QT, and they cut rates, they stopped tightening, and the markets recovered.\\n\\nAnd in that sense we have a similar pattern evolving towards the August inflection point. But the big difference is, of course, inflation, and they keep insisting they're going to hit their 2% inflation target. And I think that's debatable.

There's a series of variables that I look at related to money flows, and some of them are technical and some of them are behavioral.

ASML's revenue in the first quarter was up 91.4% Y/Y to €6.7 billion as its gross margin stood at 50.6% while its net income was €2 billion.

Thanks to this, it's likely that if ASML continues to aggressively grow its sales as it did in the previous couple of quarters, then it has all the chances of reaching €30 billion to €40 billion in annual sales by 2025 per its calculations that were presented at the end of last year.\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=551562e198f05a2d03f4739dcf69faa0b861bcb18a6e69663066fb3d0123fe13'}),\n",

From the Q1 earnings call transcript, I learned that AMD's management sees macro headwinds lasting through the first half of this year; however, they see the demand environment improving in the back half of 2023, with emerging technologies like AI set to drive greater demand for AMD's products for years to come.\\n\\nAMD Q4 2022 Earnings Transcript\", metadata={'source': 'https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=951487b9793aa38e9e3be94c02759ad93ba1d291cbe2fea74930c9a2f9be87bb'}),\n",

While its near-term financial performance is set to remain under pressure, AMD is gaining market share across all of its business segments in this tough macroeconomic environment.
